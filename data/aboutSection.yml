  ## About me

  I enjoy to tacke the complex problems from supply chains and others areas.
content: >
  I am Research and Development Engineer at See-d since january 2019. I obtained my degree in engineering mathematics at [Escuela Politécnica del Ecuador](epn.edu.ec). I received my Ph.D from [Université de Bretagne-Sud](https://www.univ-ubs.fr/fr/index.html).
  
  > I love to solve the complex problem and find better solutions throught metaheuristics and IA.

  > I always try my best to make user interface using web apis, dockers and web technologies like angular.

   ### Deal with complex issues

  For solving complex problems in various fields, I apply four main steps :
    - Understanding of the issue through discussions. Determination of objectives and constraints
    - Mathematical modeling of problem and analysis of possible solutions
    - Study and implementation of solving algorithms like metaheuristics or Artificial Intelligence algorithms
    - User interface development and writing of a technical report
